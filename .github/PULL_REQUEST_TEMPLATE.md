## Add yourself to team.json

Thanks for joining! Please follow the checklist below.

- [ ] I added my entry to `team.json`.
- [ ] My entry includes `name` and `github`.
- [ ] The list is sorted by name (case-insensitive).
- [ ] JSON is valid (no trailing commas).

If you need help, open an issue instead: “Add me to team”.
