# How to join

### First option (preferred):
1. Fork the repo.
2. Edit `team.json` and add yourself (keep the list sorted by name).
3. Open a pull request.

### Second option (fallback):
1. Open an “Add me to team” issue and fill in the form. Maintainers will copy your details into `team.json`.

Example entry:

```json
{
  "name": "Full Name",
  "github": "github-handle",
  "role": "Optional role",
  "timezone": "UTC-5",
  "links": [
    { "label": "Website", "url": "https://example.com" }
  ]
}
```
